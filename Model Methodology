Here's a full end-to-end outline to develop the credit_pd_mortgage_uk_ifrs9_adverse_12m_prime_v1 model, aligning with IFRS 9 and incorporating UK mortgage market segmentation and variables.


---

1. Terms of Reference 

Objective:
Estimate 12-month Probability of Default (PD) for UK prime mortgage exposures under adverse macroeconomic conditions, in accordance with IFRS 9.

Model Name:
credit_pd_mortgage_uk_ifrs9_adverse_12m_prime_v1

Portfolio:
UK-resident owner-occupied and BTL prime mortgage book

Model Type:
Hybrid logistic regression (with macro adjustments), potentially with challenger ML models

Time Horizon:
12-month forward-looking PD

Segments:

Owner-Occupied vs BTL

Repayment vs Interest-Only

Region: London, South East, North West, etc.

Loan Vintage (Origination Year)

Product Type: Fixed vs Variable Rate

First-time buyer (FTB) vs home-mover

Loan Purpose: Purchase vs Remortgage



---

2. Definition of Default (IFRS 9-aligned)

Calibrated to IFRS 9 standards:

Arrears > 90 days past due

Unlikeliness to pay criteria (e.g., forbearance, bankruptcy, voluntary surrender)

Incorporate probability of cure and backstops for staging



---

3. Variable Longlist

A. Borrower Characteristics

Age at origination

Employment status

Income type (e.g., salaried, self-employed)

Total household income

Number of dependents

Credit bureau score

Credit card utilisation

Historical delinquencies


B. Loan Characteristics

Original LTV

Current LTV

LTI (Loan-to-Income)

Term at origination

Remaining term

Interest rate type (fixed/variable)

Reversion rate margin

Repayment type (repayment vs IO)

Loan size

Purpose (purchase/remortgage)

Number of prior refinances


C. Property Attributes

Region (postcode level, bucketed)

Property type (flat, terraced, semi, detached)

New build indicator

Valuation type (AVM vs physical inspection)


D. Account Performance

Arrears status (number of missed payments)

Time since last delinquency

Days past due (DPD)

Forbearance flag

Payment holidays (COVID or otherwise)

Recent account activity (voluntary payments, redraws)


E. Macroeconomic Variables (linked to adverse scenario)

UK GDP growth (YoY)

Unemployment rate

HPI (House Price Index)

Interest rate (BoE base rate)

CPI inflation

Consumer confidence index



---

4. Data Preparation

Merge loan tape, arrears data, property valuations, macro forecasts

Generate vintage and roll-forward variables

Apply data cleaning rules: missing handling, outlier treatment

Variable transformations (e.g., WoE, binning, log transformations)



---

5. Segmentation

Initial splits for modeling:

Owner-occupied vs BTL

Repayment vs IO

By LTV band (<60%, 60–80%, 80–90%, 90%+)

Regional clusters (London/South East vs Midlands/North vs Scotland/Wales)

Vintage buckets (pre-2010, 2010–2015, post-2015)



---

6. Model Development Approach

A. Benchmark Model

Logistic regression with WoE bins

Backward selection (AIC/BIC)

Interactions tested (e.g., LTV × region)


B. Challenger Models

XGBoost or LightGBM

Elastic Net Logistic Regression

Ensemble stacking (optional)


C. Model Performance

Gini, KS, AUC

Stability Index (PSI) on OOT

Confusion matrix for PD buckets



---

7. Macroeconomic Overlay (Adverse)

Link macro variables to PD shifts via satellite models

Apply adverse scenario shocks using BoE stress scenarios or internal forecasts

Translate to PD scaling factors (e.g., via error correction or regression-on-residual models)



---

8. Calibration and Output

Calibrate model outputs to Observed Default Rate (ODR) or Through-the-Cycle (TTC) estimates

Apply IFRS 9 overlays for:

Forward-looking bias

Staging implications


Cap PDs where needed (e.g., max cap at 25% for prime)

Ensure monotonicity for risk drivers like LTV, arrears



---

9. Validation

Out-of-time (OOT) and Out-of-sample (OOS) testing

Independent validation team review

Model documentation (including assumptions, limitations, and use test)



---

10. Deployment Considerations

Embed in risk engines (SAS, Python, etc.)

Update frequency: Quarterly or semi-annually

Regular monitoring: Performance drift, macro indicator monitoring

Recalibration process defined (at least annually)
