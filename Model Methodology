Methodology

1. Data Sources

Internal Lending Data: Loan-level monthly performance history (5+ years), covering origination, repayment behavior, delinquencies, and default events.

Bureau Data: Credit score history, utilization metrics, and external delinquencies.

Macroeconomic Variables (UK-specific):

House Price Index (HPI)

Unemployment rate

Bank of England base rate

Real GDP growth

Inflation (CPI)



2. Feature Engineering

Static Features:

LTV at origination, income verification type, term length, geographic region, product type (fixed/variable).


Dynamic Features:

Days past due, rolling 3-month payment ratios, utilization changes, LTV recalculated with latest HPI.


Macroeconomic Linkages:

Forecast macro series mapped via lagged transformations and interaction terms.



3. Model Architecture

Algorithm: LightGBM with class-weighted loss function to handle default imbalance.

Target Definition: Binary flag for default within the next 12 months.

Training/Validation:

Time-based split ensuring training on pre-COVID periods and validation on more recent adverse outcomes.

AUC: 0.83 | Brier Score: 0.056 | KS Statistic: 42



4. Adverse Scenario Calibration

Scenario based on a 2.5% contraction in GDP, a 3 percentage point rise in unemployment, and a 10% fall in HPI.

Macroeconomic variables shocked in line with Bank of England stress paths.

Marginal PD uplift modeled via interaction layers between borrower sensitivity and macro shifts.
