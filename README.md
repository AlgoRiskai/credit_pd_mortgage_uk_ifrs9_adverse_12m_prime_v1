# credit_pd_mortgage_uk_ifrs9_adverse_12m_prime_v1
Model Overview

This model estimates the 12-month Probability of Default (PD) for prime residential mortgage customers in the United Kingdom, aligned with the IFRS 9 impairment framework and calibrated to an adverse macroeconomic scenario. Version 1 (v1) is developed using gradient-boosted decision trees (GBDT), leveraging historical credit performance and forward-looking macroeconomic data.

The model is designed for use in expected credit loss (ECL) calculation pipelines, supporting both Stage 1 and Stage 2 classifications under IFRS 9. It incorporates scenario-based stress adjustments to reflect adverse macroeconomic conditions and integrates feature engineering best practices tailored to UK prime mortgage lending.
