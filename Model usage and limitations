Adverse macro scenarios are based on stylized assumptions and may not fully capture idiosyncratic tail risks.

Data is limited to prime borrowers; extrapolation to near-prime or buy-to-let requires caution.

Behavioral response to rate changes is approximated via lagged variables; no direct borrower reactivity model.
